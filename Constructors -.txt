Constructors :-
-> constructor is a special method
-> is used to construct an object while creating it.
-> is to initialize instance variables with values, while creating object.
-> constructor name should same as class name.
-> constructor should not have return type
-> types of constructor :-
      1. Default constructor
      2. parametric Constructor(parameterized constructor)
      3. copy constructor
-> every class with have a default constructor and that will be the triggered upon creation of each object of the class.

** This keyword in java :-
1. this keyword in java represents the current object
2. this keyword has several uses in java
    -> used to access instance members of the class within the class
  -> used to distinguish instance variable and local variables
-> used in constructor chaining
**objects to functions is always call by reference in java
**objects are always passed

LENGTH OF A STARIGHTLINE;-
COMPOSITION - FUNDAMENTALL--------->>> oops concept :- where one class contains objects of other classes inside it as fields.
composition is also called as "has-a" relationship.
INHERITANCE :- A process of one class acquiring properties of another.
- In java, ew use extends keywords to perform inheritance
- class student extends person
student            person
child class       parent class
sun class         super class
derived class   base class

Types of Inheritance :
---------------------------
1. Single Inheritance --> one parent - one child class
2.Hierarchical Inheritance --> one parent - multiple child classes
3.Multi-level Inheritance --> grand parent - parent - child
4.Hybrid Inheritance
5.Multiple Inheritance --> more than one parent class - one child class 
                                   --> JAVA DOESN'T SUPPORT 

METHOD OVERRIDING :
writing the same method with same signature in the child class
